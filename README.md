🎓 I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Leiden University.

💻 The code at this account consists of personal projects, as well as work I have undertaken in my academic career. This includes mandatory course projects, as well as things I stumbled upon during my courses that I found particularly intriguing and decided to explore in code.
